    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Danny Huang, I am a third-year design concentration student in interactive arts and
        technology at Simon Fraser University with an interest in graphic design & 
        3D modeling.Through the years of studying concepts of design, I have established
        knowledge in creating immersive design with meaningful interactions
        to users. I began the design process by creating initial sketches to
        envisage concepts, to assimilate feedback, and improve it into a final
        work of art. I have also developed technical skills in using Procreate,
        Photoshop, Indesign, Onshape, and Figma to assist my design process.
