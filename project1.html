            <p>In a materials in design course, I worked in a group of two to create the Bathhouse from the movie, 
                Spirted Away. We discovered that the bathhouse was the central building in the movie, and we thought that 
                it would be interesting to recreate the Bathhouse with nature surrounding it.</p>

        <div class = "projectdes">
            <img src = images/stage1.png alt = "stage 1" width = "1000" height = "520">
            <p>We separated the building process into three stages, the first stage was to create the base of the bathhouse. 
                We started by hot gluing the foam boards around the empty tissue box to have a foundation to work with. 
                By having the structure, we created small windows around it with pop sticks, cross-stitch canvas and corrugated paper. 
                The small pop sticks added small details to the windows and it enhanced the appearance of the bathhouse.</p>

        <h2>Stage 2</h2>
        <div class = "projectdes">
            <img src = images/stage2.png alt = "stage 1" width = "1000" height = "520">
            <p>The second stage is to create the windows and balconies of the bathhouse. We used recycled card stock to be floor and covered with coffee stir sticks. 
                The coffee stir sticks created the floor textures, it is also used on top of the small sticks to support the corrugated paper as roof. 
                We hot glued the cross-stitch canvas behind the small pieces of bamboo skewers as walls and used pop sticks to support the windows. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Stage 3</h2>
        <div class = "projectdes">
            <img src = images/stage3.png alt = "stage 1" width = "1000" height = "520">
            <p>The roof of the bathhouse is mainly constructed with corrugated paper and recycled card stocks. 
                The overall structure of the roof is constructed with four pieces of corrugated paper and covered with a larger piece on the top. 
                We added small pieces of corrugated paper to create additional details on the roof. 
                We also used recycled card stock to ensure the shape of the overall structure and used it to support the corrugated paper. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Details</h2>
        <div class = "projectdes">
            <img src = images/details.png alt = "stage 1" width = "1000" height = "520">
            <p>We created our base from Makercase with the dimension of a width 12 inch, height 2 inch, and depth 12 inch. 
                We utilized the MDF board for our base because it provides stability and easy-to-apply acrylic paints.  
                The main goal is to have the MDF board to be colored with blue and we will apply resin on top to create the ocean texture. 
                For the two isolated islands, we want to color the top with green and apply flocking afterwards. lastly, 
                we want to surrounded the two islands with clay to create the texture of cliffs. We used clay to create more details, such as the character Kaonashi (No Face), 
                the flower, the train and the fish head stone which appeared in the movie poster.</p>
