            <p>In an interface design course, I worked in a group of three to create a news app for seniors. 
                The purpose of the app is that Users can run a quick background check on each one of them to confirm their credibility. 
                Users are able to provide their opinions and comment on each articles. They can also refer to the comments to determine whether if they articles are trustworthy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <div class = "project1img">
            <img src = images/p2iteration1.png alt = "stage 1" width = "1000" height = "520">
            <p>This iteration mainly focuses on using the colours of red, blue, navi blue, and beige. 
                Considering our design domain is seniors who follow closely to news to stay informed
                but not predisposed to misinformation, we wanted to have a clear hierarchy when displaying information. 
                </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "project1img">
            <img src = images/p2iteration2.png alt = "stage 1" width = "1000" height = "520">
            <p>For the second iteration, we emphasise on the layout of elements to ensure users can clearly identify the function throughout the app. 
                The usage of red is to highlight the clickable and important elements. We explored the idea of creating images based interfaces that 
                can convey information to readers visually.  </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "project1img">
            <img src = images/p2iteration3.png alt = "stage 1" width = "1000" height = "520">
            <p>The third iteration combined the ideas of iteration one and two but to explore the possibilities of using the colour purple. 
                This iteration will be texts based to include more information that allow readers to fully understand the situations. However, 
                 might not be able to read lengthy texts and it will create difficulties for them to connect the information together.
